dengue-Madeira-2012
===================

Until last year, dengue had disappeared from the European continent. The last epidemic goes back to 1927-1928, 
in Greece.
However, concerns of a return of dengue in Europe has started to rise in the recent years, due to the dissemination 
of Aedes albopictus. This mosquito plays a central role in dengue transmission, as it serves as a vector for the 
virus. Severeal European Research programs have been launched to improve our understanding of dengue, on several aspects
that are key to predicting and preventing coming epidemics. 


In September 2012 a first epidemic occured in Europe, on the Portughese island of Madeira: [2159 cases were recorded
over 3 months][1]. Among these case, a few individuals were hospitalised for mild symptoms of fever but no severe case
has been recorded. 



Although dengue remains mysterious on multiple and crucial aspects, some epidemiologists argue that severe cases 
correspond to secondary infections: after having previsouly been infected with one of the 4 dengue strains,
an individual that is re-infected with another strain would have a much higher probability of developing 
severe symptoms as hemorragic dengue fever. If we follow this assumption, and consider that all infections that occured
in 2012 were primary infection, there is a risk for severe cases in 2013 if any of the primary infected gets re-infected.


We illustrate here how mechanistic models can encompass the complex and non-linear dynamics of epidemics, 
and can be used to forecast coming epidemics while reflecting the different sources of uncertainty. We have used a
multi-strain model that has been introduced by [Aguiar et al][2] to study dengue dynamics in South-East Asia. This model 
accounts for 

> strain competition: we know that four strains of dengue coexist
>
> cross immunity: after recovering from being infected with one strain, individuals are resistant to all strains
for a short period
>
> under-reporting: manu
